  },
  {
    "question": "Tell me about SwimTO ",
    "answer": "SwimTO :\n\nCore Rules\n\n\n1. **Always use Vault** - Any secret, API key, password, token, or sensitive configuration MUST be stored in Vault\n2. **Never hardcode secrets** - No secrets in code, config files, environment variables, or deployment manifests\n3. **Vault first** - When adding new features requiring secrets, store them in Vault first, then reference via External Secrets Operator\n4. **External Secrets Operator** - Automatically syncs secrets from Vault to Kubernetes secrets every 24 hours\n5. **No alternatives** - Do not use Kubernetes secrets directly, ConfigMaps for secrets, or any other secret management solution"
  },
  {
    "question": "Tell me about SwimTO ",
    "answer": "SwimTO :\n\nWhat Goes in Vault\n\n\n- Database passwords and connection strings\n- API keys (OpenAI, Leonardo.ai, external services)\n- OAuth credentials (client IDs, client secrets)\n- Admin tokens and secret keys\n- Service account credentials\n- TLS certificates and keys\n- Any other sensitive configuration values"

    "answer": "SwimTO :\n\nWhen in Doubt\n\n\n**If you're unsure whether something should go in Vault:**\n\n- **Ask yourself:** \"Is this sensitive or could it be used maliciously?\"\n- **If yes:** Put it in Vault\n- **If no:** Use ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration\n\n**Remember:** Vault is the source of truth. All other systems (Kubernetes, applications, CI/CD) consume from Vault, never the other way around.\n\n---"
