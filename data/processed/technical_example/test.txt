Q: How do I deploy an application to Kubernetes?

A: To deploy an application to Kubernetes, you need to create a Deployment manifest. First, create a YAML file defining your deployment with the container image, replicas, and other specifications. Then use `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` to deploy it. For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Troubleshooting

When a pod fails to start, check:

1. Pod status: `kubectl describe pod pod-name`
2. Container logs: `kubectl logs pod-name`
3. Events: `kubectl get events`
